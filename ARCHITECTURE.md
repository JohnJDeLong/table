# Architecture

## Overview


Table is a multi-provider, multi-agent decision workspace where advisors determine speaking order via an urgency-rating protocol and continue discussion round-by-round until collective urgency drops below a threshold, signaling that the room has reached a natural stopping point and informal consensus, or the user intervenes.

The system has three logical layers:

1. **Provider adapter layer** — normalizes the differences between LLM provider SDKs behind a single streaming interface
2. **Orchestration layer** — runs the urgency-rating round, sequences responses, manages cross-agent context, decides when the room pauses
3. **UI layer** — Minutes-style transcript with real-time streaming and user controls

## The Urgency Mechanic

This is the core product mechanic. Every user message triggers a two-phase orchestration.

### Phase 1: Urgency Rating (parallel, fast, cheap)

All advisors are called in parallel with a small prompt:

> "Rate your urgency to respond on a 1-10 scale. 10 means staying quiet would seriously hurt the conversation. 1 means you have nothing distinct to add. Reply only with JSON: { urgency: number, reason: string }."

Phase 1 uses each provider's *cheap* tier (e.g. claude-haiku, gpt-4o-mini, gemini-flash) since the response is a small JSON. Cost matters here — Phase 1 runs every round.

### Phase 2: Sequential Response (in urgency order)

Advisors are sorted by urgency descending. Each then generates its full streamed response in order, with all previous responses *in this round* included in its context. Phase 2 uses each provider's flagship model.

### Pause Conditions

After each round, a fresh urgency check runs. The conversation auto-pauses when:

- Maximum urgency across all advisors falls below a threshold (default 3) — "the room has gone quiet"
- Round counter hits a hard cap (default 10) — safety net against runaway loops
- User manually interrupts

### Prompting Note

Frame urgency as "how much would the conversation suffer if you stayed quiet?" — *not* "how strongly do you feel about this?" The first produces meaningful variance. The second just gets every model rating itself 7+.

## Orchestration Loop (Pseudo-Code)

while (true):

  scores = parallel(rateUrgency(advisors))

  if max(scores) < pause_threshold:
      emit("room_quiet")
      break

  ordered = sort(scores descending)

  for advisor in ordered:
      streamResponse(advisor)

  if round_count >= max_rounds:
      emit("round_cap_reached")
      break

## Provider Abstraction

Each provider sits behind a uniform interface. Note the distinction between the **provider input shape** (`ProviderMessage`) and the **persisted entity** (`Message` in the data model below). The DB `Message` carries metadata — id, timestamps, urgency scores, speaker info — that providers don't need or accept. The orchestrator transforms `Message[]` into `ProviderMessage[]` at the adapter boundary.

```typescript
type ProviderMessage = {
  role: "user" | "assistant";
  content: string;
};

interface LLMProvider {
  rateUrgency(
    systemPrompt: string,
    conversation: ProviderMessage[]
  ): Promise<{ urgency: number; reason: string }>;

  streamResponse(
    systemPrompt: string,
    conversation: ProviderMessage[]
  ): AsyncIterable<string>;
}
```

Adapter implementations:

- `AnthropicAdapter` — wraps `@anthropic-ai/sdk`
- `OpenAIAdapter` — wraps `openai` SDK
- `GeminiAdapter` — wraps `@google/generative-ai`
- `GrokAdapter` — wraps xAI's API (or Mistral fallback if Grok access is blocked)

Each adapter handles its provider's quirks:

- Streaming format normalization (each provider streams differently)
- Message format normalization (system prompt placement, role names)
- Error handling and retries
- Token counting (for cost tracking)

The orchestrator never knows or cares which provider is behind a given advisor. Adding a fifth provider in the future means writing one new adapter file.

## Data Model

```
Boardroom
  id
  name              "Career Council"
  description
  pause_threshold   3
  max_rounds        10
  created_at

Advisor
  id
  boardroom_id
  name              "Marcus"
  role              "CTO, pragmatic operator"
  persona_prompt    "You push back hard on hype..."
  provider          "anthropic" | "openai" | "google" | "xai"
  model             flagship model identifier
  rating_model      cheap model identifier for Phase 1
  color             "#e74c3c"
  position          ordering within the boardroom

Conversation
  id
  boardroom_id
  title             auto-generated from first user message
  created_at

Message
  id
  conversation_id
  speaker_type      "user" | "advisor"
  speaker_id        nullable, advisor_id when type="advisor"
  round_number
  urgency_score     nullable, populated for advisor messages
  urgency_reason    nullable
  content
  created_at
```

For MVP, advisors are created from a hardcoded set of 4 defaults (one per provider). Custom advisor creation is a stretch feature.

## API Surface

Backend exposes:

- `POST /api/conversations` — start a new conversation in a boardroom
- `GET /api/conversations/:id` — fetch full conversation history
- `POST /api/conversations/:id/messages` — user sends a message; opens an SSE stream emitting round events
- `POST /api/conversations/:id/interrupt` — user interrupts the current round
- `GET /api/boardrooms` — list boardrooms
- `GET /api/boardrooms/:id` — fetch boardroom + advisors

The SSE stream from `POST /messages` emits typed events:

- `round_start` — `{ round_number }`
- `urgency_score` — `{ advisor_id, urgency, reason }` (one per advisor)
- `speaker_start` — `{ advisor_id }`
- `token` — `{ advisor_id, text }`
- `speaker_end` — `{ advisor_id }`
- `round_end` — `{ round_number, paused: boolean, pause_reason: string }`
- `error` — `{ message }`

## Frontend Structure

The UI is a single-page React app. The main view is the **Minutes transcript** — a typed-document layout with timestamped speaker labels, no chat bubbles. Each advisor has a color and a name, but the visual identity is the document, not the avatars.

Key components:

- `MinutesTranscript` — the main scrolling document
- `MessageBlock` — one user message or one advisor response
- `UrgencyBadges` — the live "show of hands" before responses start streaming
- `RoundIndicator` — tells the user which round and whether the room paused
- `ComposerBar` — input field with pause/interrupt controls
- `BoardroomSidebar` — switch between boardrooms (stretch)

## Key Trade-offs and Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Turn order | Urgency-based, not round-robin | Differentiator and emergent behavior |
| Cross-agent awareness | Yes — each speaker sees prior speakers in this round | Enables real debate, not parallel monologues |
| Round termination | Self-paused via urgency threshold | Prevents runaway costs while feeling natural |
| Persona work | Baked-in defaults for MVP, custom in stretch | Demo magic requires personas; building a persona editor is post-MVP |
| Persistence | Postgres for MVP if time, localStorage fallback | Real DB is better signal but localStorage unblocks the build |
| Deploy | Stretch goal | Local + recorded video demo is acceptable fallback |
| UI aesthetic | Minutes (document) not chat | Differentiation from every other AI app |

## Known Limitations & Future Work

- **Token context growth.** Long conversations include the full transcript in every model's context, which scales quadratically in cost. Future: after round N, summarize older rounds into a rolling context summary while preserving recent turns verbatim.
- **No agent memory across conversations.** Each conversation is independent. Future: per-advisor long-term memory of the user.
- **No multi-modal.** Text only. Future: voice input/output, image attachment.
- **Single-user.** No accounts or auth. Future: shared boardrooms, collaborative sessions.
- **No analytics.** No usage tracking, no quality scoring, no A/B framework.


## Terminology

Advisor = configured persona backed by a provider model
Agent = runtime execution of an advisor during a turn
Provider = LLM backend (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI)
Round = one urgency cycle
Turn = one advisor speaking
Session = one conversation instance
Transcript = persistent meeting record
